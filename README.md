# <text-editor-pwa>

## Description

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

- The motivation for the project was to use code that was alraedy given to us and finish its functionality so that the application can run sucessfully also, we want to be able to deploy to Heroku.

- This project was built to create an application that works online and offline.

- The problem this project solves is to have offline functionality for an application so that the user can be able to access past history when a browser is not running online. This is great because it makes an application independent of online accessibility and fully functionable.

- What did you learn?
Through this app, I learned about database, installation and editor file functionality in regards to how the application's database gets built on command and how the functionality works on the browser to store data accessed previously. I thought this was very cool once seen on the app running. I thought it was fun and i enjoyed getting to discover those apsects of the challenge. I think in regards to Heroku deployment, that counts as a challenge of its own and it is less intuitive to navigate.
